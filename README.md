# Performance-Evaluation-of-Binary-Search-Tree-and-Red-Black-Tree
Data Structures and Algorithms

[1] Evaluated the performance of Red black tree and binary search tree for two different input sequences the first being randomly generated numbers and second both with specific integers and random numbers.


[2] Height of the tree and average number of key comparisons were the two metrics employed to evaluate the performance.


[3] Insertion and search are been done as part of the project for both the trees and a parameter count has been initialized to just increment the count for repetitive numbers.


[4] As per evaluation its observed that Red black tree performed better as it is self balancing.
